## Documentation

You can do this either with a local clone, or by creating and editing files directly in the browser.

For details on working in the browser, see
* [Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files), and
* [Editing Files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).

> Note: When you are done with your edits, under **Commit Changes** you should edit the commit message, and then choose "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"

Create new documents as Markdown files (a file with a `.md` extension) in the `docs` directory.
Use the [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
format to make sure they display correctly on the site.

More detail on writing documentation on GitHub is available under **Writing on GitHub** in the GitHub [Get Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) docs.
