Participants may decline to answer questions. If Centers want to obtain information on additional issues related to COVID-19, they may do so locally, but any additional material will not be collected for NACC.</p> </div> </div> </div> <p>This form serves as an update to the original COVID-19 impact Survey released in summer 2020, and reflects on several important updates since that time, including vaccinations, repeat infections, evolving understanding of the long-term impacts of COVID-19 particularly on cognitive function, and broader psychosocial stressors which occurred in the same timeline as the initial and subsequent waves of the pandemic. In addition, it is recognized that many of these aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have been experienced differently person to person as well as community to community. The survey is intended to capture a summative experience since the onset of the pandemic, may be used either during initial or follow-up visits, and is potentially adaptable to delivery between those times.</p> <p><strong>Attached to this participant form is a supplemental form</strong> for co-participants/caregivers of participants with a CDR® > 0.5. This survey is also optional for Centers. Again, if Centers want to obtain information on additional caregiver issues related to COVID-19, they may do so locally, but this additional material will not be collected for NACC.</p> <p>These surveys may be administered by Centers in conjunction with, or unique and separate from, annual in-person or telephone UDS visits. The timing and option to participate in collection of this important data is entirely up to the individual Centers that are part of the NIA ADRC Program. Each Center should consider administering these surveys to as many participants as possible through either mail, telephone, video, and/or in-person contacts. Centers will need to provide information to participants about local vaccination availability for unvaccinated participants that request information.</p> <p>We have tried to capture important scientific information regarding COVID-19 exposure, medical consequences, and impact on social situations; on cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral issues; and on caregiver burden and related issues. This information may prove to be extremely useful in our understanding of the impact of such a pandemic on the aging population today and the future. </p></div>",,,,,,,,,,,,,
