Participants with cognitive impairment and no Alzheimer’s disease etiologic diagnosis have NACCALZD=0. To determine whether the participant was cognitively impaired, not MCI, or had MCI or dementia, refer to the NACCUDSD variable. 

It is important to note that the criteria for an etiologic diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is different across versions of the UDS:
- In v1.2 and v2 the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria were applied
- In v3 and v4 the NIA-AA criteria for AD dementia are applied

While these criteria are quite similar, they do have subtle differences. Please refer to the UDS coding guidebooks for additional information about these different criteria.

Note that variables indicating a diagnosis of probable and possible AD (NINCDS/ADRDA criteria) were collected in UDS v1.2 and v2 and are no longer collected in UDS v3. 

Note that among cognitively or behaviorally impaired participants who had visits assessed using UDS v3 and v4, their clinical syndrome(s) during that particular UDS visit can be determined by examining the following variables: DYEXECSYN, AMNDEM, PCA, NACCPPA, NACCBVFT, NACCLBDS, PSPSYN, CTESYN, CBSSYN, MSASYN, NAMNDEM, OTHSYN.

Note that in UDS v4, Parkinson's disease is not assessed as an etiologic diagnosis. To focus on individuals with Parkinson’s disease in UDS v1-3, refer to the variable PARK. In UDS v4, refer to NACCLBDS and LBDSYNT to determine whether participants have Parkinson's disease as a clinical syndrome.
