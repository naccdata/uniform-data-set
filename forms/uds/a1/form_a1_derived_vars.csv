Although this variable is not collected at follow-up visits, the value will be carried forward from the prior visit. Note that code 7 (Middle Eastern or Northern African) was added in v4. 

v4:
NACCNIHR is derived from the RACEAIAN, RACEASIAN, RACEBLACK, RACEMENA, RACENHPI, RACEWHITE, and RACEUNKN variables:

NACCNIHR = 1 	for participants with only RACEWHITE = 1
NACCNIHR = 2 	for participants with only RACEBLACK = 1
NACCNIHR = 3 	for participants with only RACEAIAN = 1
NACCNIHR = 4 	for participants with only RACENHPI = 1
NACCNIHR = 5 	for participants with only RACEASIAN = 1
NACCNIHR = 6 	for participants with more than one of RACEWHITE, RACEBLACK, RACEAIAN, RACENHPI, RACEASIAN, RACEMENA = 1
NACCNIHR = 7 	for participants with only RACEMENA = 1
NACCNIHR = 99 	for participants with RACEUNKN = 1 and/or all of RACEWHITE, RACEBLACK, RACEAIAN, RACENHPI, RACEASIAN, RACEMENA = 0

For multiracial participants (NACCNIHR =6), additional information can be found by looking at the RACEWHITE, RACEBLACK, RACEAIAIN, RACENHPI, RACEASIAN, and RACEMENA variables. 

v1-3:
Some participants reported an “other” race that is not included in the NIH race categories (e.g., Hispanic or Irish). This NACC-derived race variable attempts to include these write-in values in order to be more consistent with the NIH guidelines for human participants reporting. The categories are described as follows: 

NACCNIHR =1 for participants with RACE =1 (White) or RACE =50 (Other) with a write-in response that is considered White or Caucasian race. 
NACCNIHR =2 for participants with RACE =2 (Black or African American) or RACE =50 with a write-in response that is considered black or African American 
NACCNIHR =3 for participants with RACE =3 (American Indian or Alaska Native) or RACE =50 with a write-in response that is considered American Indian or Alaska Native 
NACCNIHR =4 for participants with RACE =4 (Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) or RACE =50 with a write-in response that is considered Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 
NACCNIHR =5 for participants with RACE =5 (Asian) or RACE =50 with a write-in response that is considered Asian 
NACCNIHR =6 for participants reporting multiple races or with RACE =50 and a write-in response indicating mixed race including, but not limited to, “multiracial,” “biracial,” and “mestizo” 
NACCNIHR =99 for participants with RACE =99 (Unknown) or with race =50 and a write-in response that cannot be classified as one of the categories without additional information, including but not limited to, “Hispanic,” “American,” and “Unknown.” 

Participants reporting multiple races (Codes 1–5 for RACE and RACESEC, or for RACE, RACESEC and RACETER) are coded to NACCNIHR =6 (Multiracial). For some multiracial participants (NACCNIHR =6), additional information on their primary, secondary, and/or tertiary race can be found by looking at the RACE, RACESEC, and RACETER variables. 

Participants reporting codes 1–5 for RACE, followed by RACESEC =50 or RACETER =50, are assigned the original primary race reported if the write-in does not indicate a different race, or is ambiguous. For example, a participant that reports RACE =1 (white) and then RACESEC =50 (other) with a write-in of “Irish” will still have NACCNIHR =1 and will not be considered multi-racial. If write-ins for RACESEC =50 or RACETER =50 are indicative of an additional race, then NACCNIHR =6. Additionally, race =99 (unknown) or ambiguous write-ins for primary race (RACE =50) that are followed by codes 1–5 for RACESEC or RACETER are coded as NACCNIHR =99.
