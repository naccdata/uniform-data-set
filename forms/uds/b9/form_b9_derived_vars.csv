-4 = Not available: UDS form submitted did not collect data in this way, or a skip pattern precludes response to this question","For follow-up visits where it is recorded that the age at which cognition symptoms began is the same as previously reported, the previous value is carried forward to facilitate analysis.

Please note that for a few participants the age of onset of cognitive decline is reported inconsistently over time. In this case, the most recently reported age of onset is usually the best data available; however, the first age reported
may be more appropriate depending on your study design.

Please note that in version 1.2 of the UDS, the follow-up visit form asked for changes since the previous visit. If “No meaningful changes” (B9CHG=1) was selected, the clinician did not complete the rest of the form. In these cases,
NACC has brought forward data from the previous visit. In cases where changes were reported on the form, the new data are provided longitudinally as recorded by the clinician. These changes apply only to those participants
who had a UDS follow-up visit using version 1.2 of the UDS (2005-2008); data collected using subsequent versions of the UDS are not affected by this change.","UDS v1-3:
