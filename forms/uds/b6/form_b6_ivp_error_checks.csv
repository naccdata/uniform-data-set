B6,I,GDS,GDS total score is equal to algorithm for partially completed GDS,"IF up to 3 of the 15 items are =9 (unanswered), then GDS is equal to the scoring algorithm: 

PRORATING SCORES (what to do if the subject does not answer up to three items): If up to three of the 15 items are unanswered (i.e., responses are 9=Did not answer), add the total score on the completed items plus an estimated score for the unanswered items to get a total score. The estimated score for unanswered items is calculated as:

 (Total score of completed items / # of completed items) * (# of unanswered items) 

You may get a fractional answer that requires rounding. For example, if the subject got a score of 5 for 12 completed items, then the estimated total score is 5 + [(5/12) * 3] = 6.25.
