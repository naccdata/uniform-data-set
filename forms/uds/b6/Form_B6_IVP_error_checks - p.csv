b6-ivp-p-1004,1004,Error,b6,I,GDS,Plausibility,GDS total score is equal to algorithm for partially completed GDS,"IF up to 3 of the 15 items are =9 (unanswered), then GDS is equal to the scoring algorithm: 
PRORATING SCORES (what to do if the subject does not answer up to three items): If up to three of the 15 items are unanswered (i.e., responses are 9=Did not answer), add the total score on the completed items plus an estimated score for the unanswered items to get a total score. The estimated score for unanswered items is calculated as:

 (Total score of completed items / # of completed items) * (# of unanswered items)

You may get a fractional answer that requires rounding. For example, if the subject got a score of 5 for 12 completed items, then the estimated total score is 5 + [(5/12) * 3] = 6.25. Since the decimal portion of this value is","IF up to 3 of the 15 items are =9 (unanswered), then Q16. GDS is equal to the scoring algorithm:
