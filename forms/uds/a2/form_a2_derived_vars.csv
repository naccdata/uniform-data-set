This NACC-derived race variable attempts to include these write-in values in order to be more consistent with the NIH guidelines for human subjects reporting. The categories are described as follows:

NACCNINR = 1 for co-participants with INRACE  =  1 (White) or INRACE  =  50 (Other) with a write-in response that is considered White or Caucasian race.
NACCNINR = 2 for co-participants with INRACE  =  2 (Black or African American) or INRACE  =  50 with a write-in response that is considered black or African American
NACCNINR = 3 for co-participants with INRACE  =  3 (American Indian or Alaska Native) or INRACE  =  50 with a write-in response that is considered American Indian or Alaska Native
NACCNINR = 4 for co-participants with INRACE  =  4 (Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) or INRACE  =  50 with a write-in response that is considered Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander
NACCNINR = 5 for co-participants with INRACE  =  5 (Asian) or INRACE  =  50 with a write-in response that is considered Asian
NACCNINR = 6 for co-participants reporting multiple races or with INRACE  =  50 and a write-in response indicating mixed race including, but not limited to, “multiracial,” “biracial,” and “mestizo”
NACCNINR = 99 for co-participants with INRACE  =  99 (Unknown) or with INRACE  =  50 and a write-in response that cannot be classified as one of the categories without additional information, including but not limited to, “Hispanic,” “American,” and “Unknown.”

Co-participants reporting multiple races (Codes 1– 5 for INRACE and INRASEC, or for INRACE, inrasec and INRATER) are coded to NACCNINR = 6 (Multiracial). For some multiracial co-participants (NACCNINR = 6), additional information on their primary, secondary, and/or tertiary race can be found by looking at the INRACE, INRASEC, and INRATER variables. 

Co-participants reporting codes 1– 5 for INRACE, followed by INRASEC = 50 or INRATER = 50, are assigned the original primary race reported if the write-in does not indicate a different race, or is ambiguous. For example, a co-participant that reports INRACE = 1 (white) and then INRASEC =50 (other) with a write-in of “Irish” will still have NACCNINR = 1 and will not be considered multi-racial. If write-ins for INRASEC = 50 or INRATER = 50 are indicative of an additional race, then NACCNINR = 6. Additionally, INRACE = 99 (unknown) or ambiguous write-ins for primary race (INRACE = 50) that are followed by codes 1– 5 for INRASEC or INRATER are coded as NACCNINR = 99. Note that if there is no change in co-participant at a follow-up visit, the co-participant data from a previous visit (visit where reported) will be carried forward to the current visit.","v1-3: no change from current code
